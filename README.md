# Centre of Composite Materials and Smart Structures

The Center of Composite Materials and Smart Structures (CCMSS) is a research centre located at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM) in Spain. Its main focus is on the research and development of Composite Materials and Smart Structures.

The CCMSS is dedicated to multidisciplinary research in the field of composite materials, both in constituent materials and manufacturing methods. Furthermore, the CCMSS has extensive experience in the field of SHM and structural monitoring.

One of the main objectives of the CCMSS is to advance the knowledge of composite materials and to promote their application in industrial applications. This is achieved through a combination of fundamental and applied research, collaborations with industry and the training of students and professionals in the field of composite materials.

The centre has a highly qualified team of researchers and professors, as well as state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. The CCM-UPM is equipped with specialised laboratories for the characterisation and fabrication of composite materials, as well as for structural monitoring using fibre optic and piezoelectric sensors. These sensors allow early detection of damage or changes in the structure, which is crucial to ensure the safety and performance of composite structures.
